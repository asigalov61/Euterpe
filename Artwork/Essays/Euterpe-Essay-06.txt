Euterpe is a Music AI system created by California's "Project Los Angeles" team. It is designed to create new pieces of music by analyzing existing ones and extracting their underlying structures.

Euterpe has been very successful so far, and has composed several new pieces of music that have been well-received by the public. One of its most notable achievements is the creation of a new piece of music based on Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

The team behind Euterpe is currently working on improving the system, and making it even more effective at creating new and original pieces of music.
